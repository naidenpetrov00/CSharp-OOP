this course gived me knowledge for the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling and building class hierarchies. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, the SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. Various debugging techniques, component testing (writing unit tests).
